A simple weather app using [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

Lots of work to do.

Uses Dotenv to load the API key. File .env must have the following line:  
API_KEY = (your_api_key_here)
This was to prevent committing it to version control, but *it will still be exposed in the bundled JS* since this runs entirely in the frontend.
